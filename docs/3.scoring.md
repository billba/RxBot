# Scoring

Pattern matching isn't always black and white. That's where *scoring* comes in. A `Scored` is an object that wraps a result with a numeric score between 0 and 1.

Any result can be wrapped in a `Scored`, but a `Scored` can't be wrapped in another `Scored`.

We create `Scored` results with a factory method called `Scored.from`. It wraps or rewraps results as appropriate, is careful not to create new objects unnecessarily, normalizes scoring, and returns `null` for results of `null`/`undefined`, or scores of zero.

```ts
import { Scored } from 'prague';

const iffyBill = Scored.from(new Value("Bill"), .5);    // Scored{ result: Value{ value: "Bill" }, score: .5 }
const iffyBill = Scored.from("Bill", .5);               // Scored{ result: Value{ value: "Bill" }, score: .5 }
const lessIffyBill = Scored.from(iffyBill, .75);        // Scored{ result: Value{ value: "Bill" }, score: .75 }
const equallyIffyBill = Scored.from(iffyBill, .5);      // returns iffyBill, i.e. equallyIffyBill === iffyBill
const equallyIffyBill = Scored.from(iffyBill);          // returns iffyBill, i.e. equallyIffyBill === iffyBill
const definitelyBill = Scored.from("Bill");             // Scored{ result: Value{ value: "Bill" }, score: 1 }
const returnsNull = Scored.from(null);                  // null
const returnsNull = Scored.from(undefined);             // null
const returnsNull = Scored.from("Bill", 0);             // null
```

`iffyBill` can be interpreted as *a 50% chance that the correct value is 'Bill'*.
`definitelyBill` can be interpreted as *the correct value is `Bill`*.

Scoring is usually a temporary operation - you wrap results with scores to determine the highest one(s), then unwrap the winner(s). To unwrap a result, call `Scored.unwrap`, which will return the wrapped result for any `Scored` and pass through any other results.

```ts
Scored.unwrap(iffyBill);    // "Bill"
Scored.unwrap("Bill");      // "Bill"
```

## Scoring in action

Say our chatbot asks the user for their name. The user's response might be their name, or they might be ignoring your question and giving a command. How can you know for sure? Certain responses are more likely than others to mean "I am telling you my name". One strategy is to assign a score to each outcome, and choose the highest-scoring outcome. That's where scoring comes in.

In this example we are maintaining `botstate` which will track whether the bot has asked the user a question.

We will add a transform which always assigns a score of 1 to a name gleaned from an unambiguously verbose introduction. Otherwise, if there is an outstanding question (the bot previously asked the user's name) it assigns a 50% chance that the entire user's response is a name. In either case we transform that `Scored string` into a `Scored ActionReference` with the same score, greeting the user.

Meanwhile we will add a different transform that is looking for the phrase "current time". If there are no outstanding questions it returns its action with a score of 1, but even if there is an outstanding question we consider that there's a pretty good chance that this phrase represents a command, so it assigns a score of .75.

We pass both these transforms to another *Prague* function, `best`, which returns a new transform which calls *all* of the transforms, collects the `Scored`s thereof, and returns the unwrapped result of the highest scoring one.

```ts
import { best } from 'prague';

const actions = new ActionReferences({
    // all the existing actions plus:
    greet(name) { ... },
    time() { ... },
 });

const botLogic = req => first(
    // all the existing transforms plus:
    best(
        match(
            first(
                match(
                    re(/My name is (.*)/i, 1),
                    Scored.from,
                ),
                t => botstate.question === 'name' ? Scored.from(t, .5) : null,
            ),
            scoredName => Scored.from(
                actions.reference.greet(scoredName.result),
                scoredName.score
            ),
        ),
        match(
            re(/current time/),
            () => Scored.from(
                actions.reference.time(),
                botstate.question ? .75 : 1
            )
        )
    )
);

// When botstate.question === 'name'
"Bill"                      // Nice to meet you, Bill
"My name is Bill"           // Nice to meet you, Bill
"current time"              // The time is 6:50:15 AM
"My name is current time"   // Nice to meet you, Current Time

// When botstate.question is undefined
"Bill"                      //
"My name is Bill"           // Nice to meet you, Bill
"current time"              // The time is 6:50:15 AM
"My name is current time"   // Nice to meet you, Current Time
```

## Understanding `best`

It's helpful to understand how `best` is implemented. 

First we need a way to work with the results of multiple transforms. You can create an array directly:

```ts
const results = [
    Scored.from("probably", .75),
    Scored.from("definitely", 1),
    Scored.from("unlikely", .25),
    Scored.from("not", 0),
    Scored.from("maybe", .50),
];
```
or you can use the `toArray` helper to create a transform which calls each supplied transform, filters out the null results, flattens any array results, and returns a (possibly empty) array. This is particularly helpful when the scored elements are coming from e.g. async services.

```ts
const getResults = toArray(
    () => Scored.from("probably", .75),
    () => Scored.from("definitely", 1),
    () => Scored.from("unlikely", .25),
    () => Scored.from("not", 0),
    () => Scored.from("maybe", .50),
);

getResults(); // [ Scored{ result: "probably", score: .75 }, Scored{ result: "definitely", score: 1 }, Scored{ result: "unlikely", score: .25}, Scored{ result: "maybe", score: .50 } ]
```

Now we can sort the array:

```ts
pipe(
    getResults,
    sort(), // sort(true) for ascending, sort() or sort(false) for descending
)() // [ Scored{ result: "definitely", score: 1 }, Scored{ result: "probably", score: .75 }, Scored{ result: "maybe", score: .50 }, Scored{ result: "unlikely", score: .25} ]
```

The last step is to take the high scoring result and unwrap it, and we have all the steps of `best`:

```ts
const best = (...transforms) => pipe(
    toArray(...transforms), // call each transform, filter out the nulls, put the rest in an array
    sort(),                 // sort them
    fromArray,              // retrieve the first element
    Scored.unwrap,          // unwrap it
);
```

## Dealing with ties

Suppose our scored values look like this:

```ts
const getGreetings = toArray(
    () => Scored.from("aloha", .70),
    () => Scored.from("hi", .75),
    () => Scored.from("wassup", .65),
    () => Scored.from("hello", .75),
);
```

What does `best` mean when there is a tie for the high score? And how sure are we of these numbers? What if we wanted to relax our tolerance a bit so that "aloha" joins "hi" and "hello" in the winner's circle?

Ultimately *Prague* leaves it to you, the developer, to decide how to resolve ties, but it does provide a helper called `top` which retrieves those high scores:

```ts
pipe(
    sortme,
    top(),
)() // [ Scored{ result: "hi", score: .75 }, Scored{ result: "hello", score: .75 } ]
```

To include "aloha" we can add a `tolerance` of 5%:

```ts
pipe(
    sortme,
    top({
        tolerance: .05,
    }),
)() // [ Scored{ result: "hi", score: .75 }, Scored{ result: "hello", score: .75 }, Scored{ result: "aloha", score: .70 } ]
```

Increasing `tolerance` includes more items in the "high score". It defaults to `0` and has a maximum value of `1`.

We can also control the maximum number of results with the `maxResults` option. Decreasing `maxResults` limits of the number of "high score" results retrieved. It defaults to `Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY` and has a minimum value of `1`.

Now that you have your list of high scores, it's up to you to decide what to do with them. Perhaps you'll list them all. Perhaps you'll pick one at random. Perhaps you'll ask for human intervention to resolve the tie. For instance, in the chatbot above you may wish to ask the user, "Are you asking the time, or telling me your name?" Of course their reply to that may also be ambiguous...

## Conclusion

In this chapter we introduced the idea of *scoring* results, and the tools necessary to reason about them: `Scored` (with its methods `from` and `unwrap`) and the helper functions `multiple`, `sort`, and `top`.

That's most of the important parts of *Prague*. In the [next chapter](./4.more.md), learn about a few miscellaneous helpers.

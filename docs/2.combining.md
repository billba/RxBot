# Combining Functions with *Prague*

In our previous chapters we refactored a chatbot into logic that returns which action to run, and the actual actions.

In this chapter we'll add a new scenario to our chatbot, and learn how to use *Prague* to elimininate up a lot of repetitive code, making our remaining code more expressive and future-proof.

## A recipe... for success!

Let's consider a new scenario for our chatbot:

```
if a user asks for a recipe
    if they provided a recipe name
        look it up
        if we find it
            return a "show recipe" action reference
        else
            return a "coudln't find recipe" action reference
    else
        tell them they need to provide a name
```

We will make use of an NLP service to interpret the user's utterance, and a recipe service to retrieve the recipe:

```ts
const { nlpService, recipeService } = require('./services');

async nlpService(modelId, text) => {
    intents: {
        name: string,
        score: number
    }[], // sorted by score descending. Always exists, may be empty array.
    entities: {
        name: string,
        value: string,
        score: number
    }[] // sorted by score descending. Always exists, may be empty array.
} (throws if model is invalid or there is a server error)

async recipeService(name) => {
    recipes: {
        name: string;
        ingredients: string[],
        instructions: string[]
    }[] // Always exists, may be empty array.
} (throws if there is a server error)
```

We'll add three new actions, a model ID, and a function that returns either `null`/`undefined` or an `ActionReference`.

```ts
const actions = new ActionReferences({
    // all the existing functions plus:
    showRecipe(recipe) { ... },
    noSuchRecipe(name) { ... },
    missingReceipeName() { ... },
 });

const modelId = "XXXX_YYYY_ZZZZ";

const recipe = async text => {
    let nlpResponse = await nlpService(modelId, text);

    if (nlpResponse.intents.length === 0 || nlpResponse.intents[0].name !== "getRecipe")
        return null;
    
    const recipeName = nlpResponse.entities.find(recipe => recipe.name === "recipeName");
    if (!recipeName)
        return actions.reference.missingRecipeName();

    recipeResponse = await recipeService(recipeName);
    
    return recipeResponse.recipes.length === 0
        ? actions.reference.noSuchRecipe(recipeName);
        : actions.reference.showRecipe(recipeResponse.recipes[0]);
}
```

Now let's add this function to our existing `botLogic`:

```ts
const botLogic = async req => {
    const artistResult = /play (.*)/i.exec(req.text);

    if (artistResult)
        return actions.reference.playArtist(artistResult[1]);

    const randomResult = /play/i.test(req.text);

    if (randomResult)
        return actions.reference.playRandom();

    r = await recipe(req.text);
    if (r)
        return r;

    return null;
}
```

## Cleaning up code with *Prague*

*Prague* is designed to clean up repetitive logic like this. Let's introduce the `first` function:

```ts
const botLogic = req => first(
    text => {
        const artistResult = /play (.*)/i.exec(req.text);

        if (artistResult)
            return actions.reference.playArtist(artistResult[1]);
    },
    text => {
        const randomResult = /play/i.test(req.text);

        if (randomResult)
            return actions.reference.playRandom();
    },
    text => {
        let r = /is my (.*) cured/i.exec(req.text);

        if (r)
            return actions.reference.healthStatus(r[1]);
    },
    async text => {
        r = await recipe(req.text);
        if (r)
            return r;
    }
)(req.text);
```

`first` is a *higher-order function*, which is to say that it takes functions as arguments and returns a new function. This new function takes its own set of arguments and calls each function argument in order, with those arguments. If that function retuns a result other than `null`/`undefined`, it returns that result. Otherwise it tries the next function. If all of the functions return `null`/`undefined`, it does too.

**Like all *Prague* functions, the functions that `first` takes as arguments can return either a result or a `Promise` of a result**, which is why that last argument can be an `async` function.

## Eliminating repetition

This new version of `botLogic` is just as repetitive as what we started with. Let's fix that.

Conveniently, `recipe` returns `null` when the text doesn't match, so we can replace:

```ts
    async text => {
        let r = await recipe(text);
        if (r)
            return r;
    }
```

with:

```ts
    text => recipe(text),
```

and that can be simplified further to:

```ts
    recipe,
```

The other tests come down to the pattern *if this function returns a result, transform that result into a different result and return that, otherwise return something else*. *Prague* has a function called `match` for this common pattern. We'll replace:

```ts
    text => {
        const artistResult = /play (.*)/i.exec(req.text);

        if (artistResult)
            return actions.reference.playArtist(artistResult[1]);
    },
```

with:

```ts
    text => match(
        text => /play (.*)/i.exec(text),
        matches => actions.reference.playArtist(matches[1])
    )(text),
```

`match` takes three functions which we'll call `getResult`, `onResult`, `onNull` (optional), and returns a new function. This new function takes its own arguments and calls `getResult` with them. If the result is `null`/`undefined` it calls `onNull` and returns that result (if `onNull` is missing, as it is here, it returns `null`). Otherwise it calls `onResult` with `getResult`'s result, and returns *that* result.

We can further simplified this to:

```ts
    match(
        text => /play (.*)/i.exec(text),
        matches => actions.reference.playArtist(matches[1])
    ),
```

Unfortunately we can't simplify `text => /foo/.exec(text)` to `/foo/.exec` because JavaScript, so *Prague* supplies a helper called `re` to eliminate just that last bit of duplication:

```ts
    match(
        re(/play (.*)/i),
        matches => actions.reference.playArtist(matches[1])
    ),
```

With all that, we can greatly simplify `botLogic`:

```ts
const botLogic = req => first(
    match(
        re(/play (.*)/i),
        matches => actions.reference.playArtist(matches[1])
    },
    match(
        re(/play/i),
        () => actions.reference.playRandom()
    },
    recipe,
)(req.text);
```

Eliminating all the repetitive code makes `botLogic` shorter. More importantly, it's also more expressive. ***Prague* code looks almost like a declarative markup language.**

## When not to use *Prague*

Now let's return to our `recipe` function. Could it be recoded with *Prague*?

Well... you *could*. Using two more *Prague* functions `pipe` and `onlyContinueIf` we end up with:

```ts
const recipe = pipe(
    text => nlpService(modelId, text),

    onlyContinueIf(nlpResponse => nlpResponse.intents.length === 0 || nlpResponse.intents[0].name !== "getRecipe"),

    match(
        nlpResponse => nlpResponse.entities.find(recipe => recipe.name === "recipeName"),
        recipeName => match(
            () => recipeService(recipeName),
            recipeResponse => actions.reference.showRecipe(recipeResponse.recipes[0]),
            () => actions.reference.noSuchRecipe(recipeName)
        )(),
        () => actions.reference.missingRecipeName()
    )
)
```

In this case even an experienced *Prague*rammer might conclude that the original was clearer. Use the right tool for the job. *Prague* is not meant to replace all your JavaScript logic. You will quickly gain a sense for when *Prague* makes your code clearer, and when it makes it more opaque. A good rule of thumb is that *Prague* is helpful when your code seems unecessarily verbose and repetitive.

But since we went to the effort, let's at least see how this code works.

`pipe` takes as arguments a sequence of functions, and returns a new function. This new function calls each supplied function in order. Its arguments become the arguments to the first function. The result of the first becomes the argument of the second, and so on. If any returns `null`/`undefined` then the new function does too, otherwise it returns the result of the last function. The idea of `pipe` is a series of transforms that fails as soon as one of the transforms fail. In fact, we call *Prague* functions "transform"s.

You may be wondering where the `text` argument to `recipe` went. Remember that `pipe(...)` returns a function. The argument to that function is the argument to the first transform, which is `text`.

`onlyContinueIf` takes a predicate as an argument and returns a new function which evaluates that predicate with its argument. If the predicate is "truthy" it returns its result, otherwise it returns `null`. `onlyContinueIf` is used as a quick way to short circuit a `pipe` if a condition is not met. In this case we're bailing out early if our NLP service doesn't think the user is asking for a recipe.

You already know about `match`. In this case we nest two `match`es.

## *Prague* and `bot`

Our previous `bot` looks like this:

```ts
const bot = (req, res) => botLogic(req).then(actions.doAction(res));
```

But it would be more *Prague*matic to see `doAction` as a final transformation:

```ts
const bot = (req, res) => pipe(
    botLogic,
    actions.doAction(res)
)(req)
```

Most *Prague* apps will look like this, so `ActionReferences` provides a helper:

```ts
const bot = (req, res) => actions.run(botLogic, res)(req);
```

## Coding for the future

As it stands, `botLogic` is a little too tightly-coupled in how it handles pattern matching.

Let's say we decide to upgrade our music service pattern-matching from regular expressions to an nlp model like we used for recipes.

Intuitively we'd like to be able to change:

```ts
    match(
        re(/play (.*)/i),
        matches => actions.reference.playArtist(matches[1])
    },
```

to something like:

```ts
    match(
        /* some sort of call to the nlp service */,
        matches => actions.reference.playArtist(matches[1])
    },
```

... but we can't, because `re(...)` returns a very different result than `nlpService`. We made the mistake of writing our `match` in such a way that it depended on the matcher implementation.

Let's refactor our match to be more agnostic about the implementation of its matcher:

```ts
    match(
        /* function that returns null | string */,
        artist => actions.reference.playArtist(artist)
    },
```

Much better. Now we can reimplement our regular expression matcher to meet this new interface using `re`'s optional second "which capture group" parameter:

```ts
const rePlayArtist = re(/play (.*)/i, 1),
```

Next, we can use `pipe` to create a helper that easily transforms the result of an nlp service for a given model, intent, and entity...

```ts
const nlp = (service, model, intentName, entityName) => text => pipe(
    service(model, text),
    r => r.intents.find(intent => intent.name === intentName) && (
        !entityName || r.entities.find(entity => entity.name === entityName)
    )
);
```
... and use that helper to create an nlp version of `rePlayArtist`:

```ts
const nlpPlayArtist = nlp(nlpService, musicModel, 'playArtist', 'artist');
```

Now we can easily replace `rePlayArtist` with `nlpPlayArtist`. More interestingly, we could dynamically choose `rePlayArtist` when we're offline and `nlpPlayArtist` when we're online:

```ts
const playArtist === botState.online ? rePlayArtist : nlpPlayArtist;
```

Do a similar thing with `playRandom` and our revised bot code looks like this:

```ts
const botLogic = req => first(
    match(
        playArtist,
        artist => actions.reference.playArtist(artist)
    },
    match(
        playRandom,
        () => actions.reference.playRandom()
    },    recipe,
    recipe,
)(req.text);
```

A fantastic result of this is that `playArtist` and `playRandom` have become independently testable. On the flip side, we could mock each of those functions to do even more types of testing.

By refactoring our `match`es, `botLogic` has become less tightly coupled and thus more flexible and testable.

## Errors and Prague

Calling a *Prague*  transform has three potential outcomes:
* It can return a result
* It can return `null`/`undefined`, usually interpreted as "this transform didn't apply"
* It can throw an exception

It's important to distinguish the last two. `null`/`undefined` is not pejorative. Nothing unexpected happened and nothing "failed". The transform simply didn't apply. You can see this in action in `recipe` - it returns `null`/`undefined` to indicate that the user wasn't asking for a recipe. On the other hand, if either of our `fetch` calls fail, it throws an exception, which you can handle:

```ts
const bot = (req, res) => actions.run(botLogic, res)(req)
    .catch(err => { 
        console.log("Exception", err);
    });
```

(Thinking about `recipe`, a more user-friendly approach would probably be to return an action letting the user know that there was an unexpected error. This exercise is left for the reader).

## Conclusion

In this chapter we added a new scenario to our chatbot, and learned how to use *Prague* to elimininate up a lot of repetitive code, making our remaining code more expressive and future-proof. Just as importantly, we also learned that *Prague* isn't the right tool for every job.

## Next

In the [next chapter](./3.scoring.md) we'll learn about dealing with multiple ambiguous matches with scoring.

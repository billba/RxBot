# More *Prague*

## `combine`

`combine` is like `pipe`, but where `pipe` is designed to short circuit as soon as a component function returns `null`, `combine` proceeds through each component function no matter what. That means that if one function can return `null`, the next one must be able to handle a `null` argument:

```ts
combine(
    a => a === "Bill" ? "Bill Barnes" : null,
    a => a ? `Hey ${a}` : "I don't know you"
)
```

By comparision, the second function in this `pipe` is guaranteed to only receive non-`null` results:

```ts
pipe(
    a => a === "Bill" ? "Bill Barnes" : null,
    a => `Hey ${a}`
)
```

## `from`

Many *Prague* helpers take functions as arguments. As has been pointed out repeatedly, these functions can return either a result or a `Promise` of a result, and can return either `undefined` in addition to `null`. Internally these are normalized to a function which returns a `Promise` of a result or `null` via a function called `from`:

```ts
const fullName = from(a => a === "Bill" ? "Bill Barnes" : null);

fullName("Bill").then(console.log); // "Bill Barnes"
fullName("Joe").then(console.log);  // null
```

All *Prague* helpers call `from` on the functions you provide, so in practice the only time you'll need to use `from` is probably if you need to make your own helper which doesn't just call one of the built-in *Prague* helpers.

## `matchif`

`match` is meant for situations where a matcher function produces a result that you would use:

```ts
match(fullName,
    fullName => { ... }
)
```

But sometimes you just want to branch on a "truthy" predicate. Consider the below:

```ts
const greet = match(a => a === "Bill",
    () => "Hi, Bill!",
    () => "I don't know you"
);

greet("Bill").then(console.log);    // "Hi, Bill!"
greet("Joe").then(console.log):     // "Hi, Bill!"
```

This seems unintuitive. What's happening here?

Rewriting the function a bit illustrates the problem:

```ts
const greet = match(a => a === "Bill",
    matched => matched.toString(),
    () => "I don't know you"
);

greet("Bill").then(console.log);    // "true"
greet("Joe").then(console.log):     // "false"
```

We might think of `a === "Bill"` as a predicate, but `match` just sees it as a function which returns a result or `null`, and both `true` and `false` are non-null results!

In these situations you can use `matchIf`, which interprets the matcher as a predicate:

```ts
import { matchIf } from 'prague';

const greet = matchIf(a => a === "Bill",
    () => "Hi, Bill!",
    () => "I don't know you"
);

greet("Bill").then(console.log);    // "Hi, Bill!"
greet("Joe").then(console.log):     // "I don't know you"
```

This can be an expressive way to arrange your code, but most simple situations can be handled with a simple ternary expression:

```ts
const greet = a => a === "Bill"
    ? "Hi, Bill!",
    : "I don't know you";
```

This is another great example of using *Prague* only when it helps you.

## `tap` and `log`

`pipe` and `combine` are two kinds of transformation chains, where the result of one function is used as the argument to the next. But sometimes you just want to *do* something without changing a value. For example:

```ts
let highScore = 0;

pipe(
    re(/my score was (.*))/,
    score => {
        if (score > highScore)
            highScore = score;
        return score;
    },
    score => `${score} is a great score!`,
)
```

In this case our second function, which only exists to update `highScore`, needs to return the argument it was passed.

The `tap` helper does this for you - executes the function it is passed, then returns the original argument:

```ts
import { tap } from 'prague';

pipe(
    re(/my score was (.*))/,
    tap(score => {
        if (score > highScore)
            highScore = score;
    }),
    score => `${score} is a great score!`,
)
```

A very common use of `tap` is to debug by logging the current result:

```ts
pipe(
    ...,
    tap(console.log),
    ...,
)
```

*Prague* provides a quick shorthand:

```ts
import { log } from 'prague';

pipe(
    ...,
    log,
    ...,
)
```

## `doAction` and `run`

We've talked about the testing value of returning `ActionReference`, but in some applications it can be overkill to have to define a function in one place, reference it another, and assemble them together at the end. On the other hand, *Prague* has a lot of helpful helpers. A middle ground is to return anonymous closures:

```ts
const greet = match(
    first(
        re(`My name is (.*)`, 1),
        re(`Je m'appelle (.*)`, 1),
        re(`G'day mate, I'm (.*)`, 1),
    ),
    name => () => console.log(`Hi there, ${name}`),
    () => () => console.log(`I don't understand you`),
);

greet("My name is Bill");   // [Function]
```

All that you need to do now is execute the function that is returned. You could just do:

```ts
greet("My name is Bill").then(m => m()); // Hi there, Bill
```

It is slightly more *Prague*matic to see this as a transform via the `doAction` helper (which parallels the `doAction` method of `ActionReferences`):

```ts
pipe(
    greet,
    doAction
)("My name is Bill"); // Hi there, Bill
```

And there is a `run` helper (which parallels the `run` method of `ActionReferences`):

```ts
run(
    greet,
)("My name is Bill"); // Hi there, Bill
```

# Creating Testable Bots by Separating Concerns

In this chapter we'll look into testing bots and see how it's possible to increase the testability of bots via a clean separation of concerns.

## Testing a bot

Let's say we're building a chatbot which allows us to play music.

```ts
const { musicService } = require('./services');

const bot = async (req, res) => {
    const artistResult = /play (.*)/i.exec(req.text);

    if (artistResult) {
        const artist = artistResult[1];
        await musicService.play(artist);
        res.send(`Playing ${artist}`);
        return;
    }

    const randomResult = /play random/i.test(req.text);

    if (randomResult) {
        await musicService.playRandom();
        res.send(`Playing random music`);
        return;
    }
}
```

Now let's test it. We need to create a mocked version of `res` so that we can easily examine the results of `send`, and create [stubs](https://sinonjs.org/releases/v6.3.4/stubs/) for our `musicService` with [Sinon.JS](https://sinonjs.org/) to ensure our tests don't actually call the service:

```ts
require('mocha');
const { expect } = require('chai');
const { musicService } = require('./services');
const { createSandbox } = require('sinon')

describe("bot", () => {
    const tests = [
        ['play artist', ['Playing artist']],
        ['play random', ['Playing random music']],
    ];
    const sandbox = createSandbox();

    beforeEach(() => {
        sandbox.stub(musicService, 'play').resolves();
        sandbox.stub(musicService, 'playRandom').resolves();
    });

    afterEach(() => {
        sandbox.restore();
    });

    for (const [text, expectedResponses] of tests) {
        it(`should respond "${expectedResponses}" when user says "${text}"`, done => {
            const actualResponses = [];

            // mock res to add each response to our array
            const res = {
                send: text => actualResponses.push(text)
            }

            bot({ text }, res).then(() => {
                expect(actualResponses).deep.equals(expectedResponses);
                done();
            });
        });
    }
});
```

The results look good!

```
bot
    ✓ should respond "Playing artist" when I say "play artist"
    ✓ should respond "Playing random music" when I say "play random"

  2 passing (11ms)
```

## The problem with testing bot output

But these successful test results hide a problem. The test for playing a specific artist is matching when someone says *play random*.

We could (should?) fix this by looking at the call count for `play` and `playRandom`. While this would work for our relatively simplistic bot which contains two possible outcomes, each mapping to a single service call, this doesn't scale to anything remotely real world.

It's common for multiple calls to be made, and refactorings to occur. The former means lots of code to ensure the right functions are being called, and the latter requires cascading updates to all of the various utterances and logic paths we're testing. It won't take long before our test code becomes unwieldy.

Our situation is a direct result of the imperative style used to code `bot` - at some point a decision is made to take an action, the action is taken, and that's that. The function representing our bot is both *determining* what action to perform, and *performing* the action.

It's hard to test, which is often an indication our code could be improved.

## Moving beyond testing output

There's a different approach, which is to split this into two steps:

1. One function which returns a *result* indicating which action to take
2. One function that *performs* that action

Our test code can separately test the first function, and the action that it should take. And our running code would simply execute both steps.

Let's create a class representing "an action to take":

```ts
class ActionReference {
    constructor (
        name: string,
        ...args: any[]
    ) {
        this.name = name;
        this.args = args;
    }
}
```

Now we can recode `bot` by starting with the decision making piece:

```ts
const botLogic = (req) => {
    const artistResult = /play (.*)/i.exec(req.text);

    if (artistResult) {
        return new ActionReference('playArtist', [artistResult[1]]);
    }

    const randomResult = /play random/i.test(req.text);

    if (randomResult) {
        return new ActionReference('playRandom');
    }

    // etc.
}
```

You may wonder why we created an `ActionReference` class when `botLogic` could have created an anonymous object literal to return, as demonstrated below:

```ts
if (artistResult)
    return {
        name: 'playArtist',
        args: [artistResult[1]];
    }
```

Spoiler: later on we will create functions that return other values and it's helpful to have a way to positively distinguish an `ActionReference` (by testing `instanceof ActionReference`) from non-`ActionReference` objects that might happen to include the same properties.

Note that `botLogic` only takes `req` as a parameter. In our refactor, `botLogic` only makes decisions about which action to take; it doesn't actually execute the action.

We'll recode our tests accordingly:

```ts
describe("botLogic", () => {
    const tests = [
        ['play artist', 'playArtist', 'artist'],
        ['play random', 'playRandom'],
    ]

    for (const [text, name, ...args] of tests) {
        it(`should call ${name}(${args.join(', ')}) when user says "${text}"`, done => {
            botLogic({ text }).then(result => {
                expect(result).deep.equals(new ActionReference(name, ...args));
                done();
            });
        });
    }
})
```

Our new test results look like this:

```
botLogic
    ✓ should call playArtist(artist) when I say "play artist"
    1) should call playRandom() when I say "play random"

  1 passing (11ms)
  1 failing

  1) should call playRandom() when I say "play random"

    AssertionError: expected { name: 'playRandom', args: [] } to deeply equal { Object (name, args) }
      + expected - actual

       {
      -  "args": [
      -    "random"
      -  ]
      -  "name": "playArtist"
      +  "args": [ ]
      +  "name": "playRandom"
       }
```

Now our test correctly spots our bug. Someone should really fix that thing.

All we need now is the final step - take the action. Here's one approach:

```ts
const botAction = async (res, action) => {
    if (!action instanceof ActionReference)
        return;

    switch (action.name) {
        case 'playArtist':
            await musicService.playArtist(action.args[0]);
            res.send(`Playing ${action.args[0]}`);
            return;

        case 'playRandom':
            await musicService.playRandom();
            res.send(`Playing random music`);
            return;

        default:
            throw `Unknown name ${action.name}`;
    }
}
```

Note that `botAction` takes `res` as an argument, but not `req` -- that's because all the arguments it needs are in `result.args`. `botAction` is not analyzing **what** to do, as `botLogic` handles that responsibility; `botAction` is solely responsible for performing the action indicated by `ActionReference`.

Now we can test each action individually. We might still need to resort to verifying the output, but that's fine, as we have solved the problem of "guess which code produced this output?" The code below does still assume a single service call for each action, but this could easily be updated as the calls grow and change.

```ts
describe("botAction", () => {
    const tests = [
        [['playArtist', 'artist'], ['Playing artist']],
        [['playRandom'], ['Playing random music']],
    ];

    for (const [[name, ...args], expectedResponses] of tests) {
        it(`should respond "${expectedResponses}" on ${name}(${args.join(', ')})`, done => {
            const actualResponses = [];
            const stub = sinon.stub(musicService, name).resolves();

            const res = {
                send: text => actualResponses.push(text)
            };

            botAction(res, new ActionReference(name, args)).then(done => {
                expect(actualResponses).deep.equals(expectedResponses);
                expect(stub.calledWith(...args)).to.be.true();
                done();
            });
        }
    }
});
```

These tests look like this:

```
botAction
    ✓ should respond 'Playing artist' on playArtist(artist)'
    ✓ should respond 'Playing random music' on playRandom()

  2 passing (11ms)
```

This shows (correctly) that our issue was with the logic determining which action to take, and not with the implementation of the action itself.

As promised, we have split `bot` into two functions -- one which returns a result indicating which action to take, independent of how that action is coded, and one which takes that action, independent of the decision making process which selected it.

We come full circle by combining the two:

```ts
const bot = (req, res) => botLogic(req).then(result => botAction(res, result));
```

This new `bot` is functionally equivalent to the original `bot`, but its concerns have been cleanly separated. Of course, there's nothing stopping us from integration testing `bot` using our original tests. The fact that the integration tests pass when the unit tests fail is a great example of the value of unit testing.

*Note*: some chatbot systems may not use cleanly separated `req` and `res` arguments -- that's too bad because it makes it harder to enforce this desirable separation of concerns.

## Improving our code

This is progress, but we've introduced some new potential problems:

* Putting every action into a giant `switch` statement is a little awkward.
* `botLogic` can create `ActionReference`s whose names do not exist -- we'll only find out when we call `botAction`

Comprehensive tests will help, but defense in depth tell us not to rely on our tests.

It would be nice if `botLogic` could only create `ActionReference`s with specific names. We can do that by using an abstraction that creates `ActionReference`s for us, checking against a predefined list of functions. This also fixes the `switch` problem.

```ts
class ActionReferences {

    constructor(getActions) {
        this.getActions = getActions;
        this.reference = {};

        for (const name of Object.keys(getActions()))
            this.reference[name] = (...args) => new ActionReference(name, ...args);
        };
    }

    doAction(...args) {
        return (result) => {
            if (!result instanceof ActionReference)
                return;

            const action = this.getActions(...args)[result.name];

            if (!action)
                throw `unknown action ${result.name}`;

            return action(...result.args);
        }
    }
}
```

Now instead of creating a `botActions` function we create a (very readable) list of actions as functions:

```ts
const actions = new ActionReferences(res => ({
    async playArtist(artist) {
        await musicService.playArtist(artist);
        res.send(`Playing "${artist}"`);
    },

    async playRandom() {
        await musicService.playRandom();
        res.send(`I can't delete "${arg}"`);
    },
}));
```

Now when `botLogic` wants to create an `ActionReference` it does so using `actions.reference`, e.g.

```ts
return actions.reference.playArtist(result[1]);
```

What's nice about this is that it resembles a normal function call, but instead of executing `playArtist`, it returns a reference to it.

Any attempt to reference a nonexistent action will immediately throw an error:

```ts
// throws because actions.reference doesn't include a "goodDog" property
return actions.reference.goodDog();
```

**Note** TypeScript will catch incorrect method names and argument types at compile time.

Our revised `botLogic` looks like this:

```ts
const botLogic = async req => {
    const artistResult = /play (.*)/i.exec(req.text);

    if (artistResult)
        return actions.reference.playArtist(artistResult[1]);

    const randomResult = /play/i.test(req.text);

    if (randomResult)
        return actions.reference.playRandom();
}
```

Our revised `bot` looks like this:

```ts
const bot = (req, res) => botLogic(req).then(result => actions.doAction(res)(result));
```

Which we can simplify to:

```ts
const bot = (req, res) => botLogic(req).then(actions.doAction(res));
```

Our test for `botLogic` stays exactly the same, because `botLogic` is still just returning `ActionReference`s, it's just creating them a little differently.

We could reuse our actions test by replacing `botAction` with `actions.doAction` and/or we could individually test each action by calling e.g. `actions.getActions(res).playArtist('artist)`.

## Conclusion

In this section we saw how it's possible to increase the testability of bots via a clean separation of concerns. We created helper classes called `ActionReference` and `ActionReferences` which also makes our code more readable.

## Next

In the [next chapter](./2.combining.md) we'll see other advantages to structuring your application to return a result instead of taking an action directly.

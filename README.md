# Prague

An experimental rule system handy for intepreting user input, great for adding conversational features to apps. I thought of it as I walked around Prague on a sunny Spring day. **This is not an official Microsoft project.**

Major features of Prague:
* strongly-typed when using TypeScript
* deeply asynchronous via RxJS

Some types of applications you could build with Prague:
* OS shell
* Chat bot
* Games

## Building Prague

* clone or fork this repo
* `npm install`
* `npm run build` (or `npm run watch` to build on file changes)

## To add to your app
`npm install prague`

# alarmbot

A sample [Prague](http://github.com/billba/prague) browser-based bot featuring the classic alarmbot. A good comparison with BotBuilder v3

Note: this sample does not actually set any alarms :-)

# How to use

1. clone the entire Prague, if you haven't already
2. go to the `samples/alarmBot` directory
3. `npm install`
4. `npm run build` (or `npm run watch` to build on changes)
5. in a different terminal window, `npm run start`
6. aim your browser at `http://localhost:8000`
